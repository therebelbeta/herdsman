A locally-hosted web dashboard to manage and monitor server microservices on a system. To help you herd the cats.

## Why?

I found that as I was working on some projects that I would end up having 5 or 6 terminals up and running servers at a time. Switching between them and keeping track of them was always an issue, and I never knew the health of the server without going directly to it. I wanted a solution that would allow me to view the terminal output, but also give additional information, like the health at-a-glance, and consolidate all of them to a single view. This is where Herdsman comes in. it *herds* the cats for you, brings them under one roof, and helps you see what they are doing.

## Work in progress

This module is a work in progress, and is nowhere near production stability. Please check back in the future for updates, or even better, [reach out to contribute!](http://twitter.com/therebelrobot)
